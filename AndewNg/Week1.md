### Machine learning examples 
	- Google search uses ML to rank pages 

	- Facebook recognize our friends in our photos 

	- Mail client filter span and not spam emails 

	- Database mining -> 
		○ Large Datasets from growth of automation/web
		○ EG web click data, medical records, biology, engineering 
		
	- Application which we cannot program our self
		○ Autonomous helicopter, handwriting recognitions, NLP, CV
        
	- Self Customizing Programs
		○ EG. Amazon, Netflix product recommendations. 
		
	- Understand human learning (brain and real AI)
	
### What is Machine Learning?
	Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.
	Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."
	Example: playing checkers.
	
    E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
	T = the task of playing checkers.
	P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
	
    In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:
	Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.

### Machine Learning Algorithms:
